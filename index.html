          <h1>Who Exactly Is Jody?</h1>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">Brief Intro</h2>
          <p>
            I am a self-motivated, tenacious, and ambitious 21 year old with a
            dedication towards managing and creating beautiful, interactive, and
            dynamic websites that engages user interaction. I am currently
            enrolled in the full-stack web development course in Umuzi, hoping
            to come out as a professional web developer by the end of my journey
            with them.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            My journey to becoming a coder started back in February of 2021
            when, back when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, I
            came across an advertisement on the radio about an academy called
            WeThinkCode and how they were offering a course to students; for
            free and with no prerequisites! So me, not knowing what career field
            I wanted to go in, had every reason to go and try this course and
            see how it goes. While I didn't get into the academy, I did discover
            that this would be a career path that I would 100% be content with
            pursuing in the future, as it involved an aspect that I love to do,
            which is creating. Having something that I can call my own and can
            be proud of creating is what I strive for, as it serves as a kind of
            validation for yourself that you are the mastermind behind this
            thing.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">What Next?</h2>
          <p>
            So naturally, after this discovery, I enrolled for another coding
            career, and that's how I found myself in the position I'm in right
            now. Although I have a long journey ahead, I'm looking forward to
            seeing just where it will lead me in the future.

          <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">What I Have learned</h2>
          <p>
            Visual Studio Code. It is the first editor that I learned and it is
            relatively beginner-friendly, so I have no reason to switch. With
            it, I have coded algorithms with javascript, as well as created this
            website with HTML and CSS. The Version Control System that I have
            learned is Git and Github so working and co-ordinating in teams is
            not a problem for me.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mini-headings">Still To Learn</h2>
          <p>
            I am looking to learn PostgreSQL, React JS, and Node.js in the
            future as required to become a web developer, but right now I am in
            the beginner stages of my journey and I know I have a lot to learn
            so I will update this in the future from "Still To Learn: X Y Z" to
            "Proficient In: X Y Z" :)

            This website right here! Again, I'm still in the beginner stages of
            becoming a developer, so I don't have that much to show you :(<br />
            <br />
            BUT! This section right here will 100% be updated in the future, so
            stay tuned...

          <h1>What I Do When I'm Not Working</h1>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">Computer Stuff</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming more knowledgeable on the components of a PC and how it
            affects applications and performance has always fascinated me and I
            continue to learn more about different systems and how they work.
            Along these comes my understanding of applications such as Excel,
            Word, PowerPoint, and others. Creating something I can call my own
            is the feeling I strive for, and that is why creating and perfecting
            code is my passion.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">Music</h2>
          <p>
            One of the career fields that I was previously interested in was
            sound engineering, but mostly it was just me thinking that music was
            the whole of sound engineering, and later I realized that it was
            much more than that. So one thing I do is make a bunch of beats from
            the fresh ideas that come up in my head, although I realized that it
            is almost impossible to replicate what is in your head. The beats
            are very laid back and harmonic, just like the type of music I
            listen to. Even though these beats are objectively mediocre, I
            treasure them because to me they represent an idea I had that has
            not been mastered yet.
