          <hr class="line-break" />
          <h3>Brief Intro:</h3>
          <p>
            I am a self-motivated, tenacious, and free-spirited 21 year old with
            a dedication towards managing and creating beautiful, interactive,
            and dynamic websites that engages user interaction. I am currently
            enrolled in the full-stack web development course in Umuzi, hoping
            to come out as a professional web developer by the end of my journey
            with them.
          </p>
          <h3>My Journey:</h3>
          <p>
            My journey to becoming a coder started back in February of 2021
            when, back when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, I
            came across an advertisement on the radio about an academy called
            WeThinkCode and how they were offering a course to students; for
            free and with no prerequisites! So me, not knowing what career field
            I wanted to go in, had every reason to go and try this course and
            see how it goes.
            <br />
            <br />
            While I didn't get into the academy, I did discover that this would
            be a career path that I would 100% be content with pursuing in the
            future, as it involved an aspect that I love to do, which is
            creating. Having something that I can call my own and can be proud
            of creating is what I strive for, as it serves as a kind of
            validation for yourself that you are the mastermind behind that
            thing.
          </p>
          <h3>What Next?:</h3>
          <p>
            So naturally, after this discovery, I enrolled for another coding
            career, and that's how I found myself in the position I'm in right
            now. Although I have a long journey ahead, I'm looking forward to
            seeing just where it will lead me in the future.

          <p>
            One of the career fields that I was previously interested in was
            sound engineering, but mostly it was just me thinking that music was
            the whole of sound engineering, and later I realized that it was
            much more than that. So one thing I do is make a bunch of beats from
            the fresh ideas that come up in my head, although I realized that it
            is almost impossible to replicate what is in your head. The beats
            are very laid back and harmonic, just like the type of music I
            listen to. Even though these beats are objectively mediocre, I
            treasure them because to me they represent an idea I had that has
            not been mastered yet.

            Writing has become one of the hobbies I never would have thought I
            would do, but yet here I am Making characters and plots that I find
            interesting. I only got into it very recently, so I am a complete
            amateur, but I hope that as time progresses, I will gain enough
            confidence to show someone one of my stories.
